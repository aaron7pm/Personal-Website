  <section class="post-content"><p><strong>CodeDay Houston Fall 2014</strong> is just around the corner!!! If you've asked yourself a question similar to <em>"What do I need to be prepared for CodeDay?"</em> or you've said something along the lines of <em>"I have no idea what I'm going to do or make"</em>. Hopefully this blog post will be helpful to you!</p>
<p>In case you don't already know already CodeDay is an event hosted in 23 cities across the nation where students get together to learn, socialize, and build something awesome in 24 hours. This is Houston's 2nd CodeDay, and it's the fastest growing CodeDay ever at a <strong>288% growth rate</strong>! We are going to have <strong>100 </strong>people at the event<br />
<br />
[su_accordion]<br />
[su_spoiler title="IMPORTANT: What we absolutely will not have" style="fancy"]</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethernet, unfortunately START Houston does not have any ethernet ports. Bring a wifi adapter if you don't have wifi capability on your device, else you won't get internet</li>
<li>A large parking lot, see parking</li>
<li>Computers, see the what's required section</li>
<li>and pretty much anything that's in the what's required section</li>
</ul>
<p>[/su_spoiler]<br />
[su_spoiler title="What we'll provide" style="fancy"]</p>
<ul>
<li>Food! We'll have tons of food!</li>
<li>Wifi</li>
<li>Seats (or so I hope)</li>
<li>SWAG - T-shirts, Stickers, &amp; more!</li>
<li>Awards!</li>
<li>Outlets and extension cords</li>
<li>Workshops for you to learn</li>
<li>Mentors (including myself)</li>
</ul>
<p>[/su_spoiler]<br />
[su_spoiler title="What's required" style="fancy"]</p>
<ul>
<li>Yourself (Though I guess you could have someone take your place, notify me)</li>
<li>A ride (ride sharing or being dropped off is HIGHLY recommended. LIMITED PARKING)</li>
<li>A computer (preferably laptop, desktops are welcome though). DON'T FORGET YOUR CHARGING CABLE</li>
<li>A sleeping bag and/or pillow if you plan on sleeping (Usually people barely sleep due to insane amounts of fun and code)</li>
<li>Any device you plan on hacking* on or for (phones, tablets, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, wearables, etc)</li>
<li>A will to learn and the spirit to hack*</li>
<li>Whatever tools you may need for learning and developing. See the tools and software section</li>
<li>Bring a wifi adapter if you don't have wifi capability on your device.</li>
</ul>
<p>[/su_spoiler]<br />
[su_spoiler title="Parking" style="fancy"]</p>
<ul>
<li>Seriously consider ride sharing or being dropped off.</li>
<li>Streets are unmetered so you can park on the streets</li>
<li>There is a small grass area behind the building, get there early and might be able to park there</li>
<li>Don't park by a hydrant</li>
<li>Don't park too close to a stop sign</li>
<li>Don't park facing the wrong direction of traffic.</li>
<li>Don't park anywhere that blocks a driveway entrance.</li>
</ul>
<p>[/su_spoiler]<br />
[su_spoiler title="Tools and Software" style="fancy"]<br />
Here's a list of tools and software you'll need for programming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Java? Use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ</a> and thank me later</li>
<li>Windows and Microsoft products install <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/visual-studio-homepage-vs.aspx" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a> (Pro is free with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/" target="_blank">BizSpark</a>)</li>
<li>Apple products such as OS X (Macs), iOS (iPhones and iPads), and possibly the upcoming iWatch install <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835" target="_blank">XCode</a> (Requires Mac)</li>
<li>Android devices such as phones, tablets, watches, Google Glass, etc we highly recommend installing <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html" target="_blank">Android Studio</a></li>
<li>For coding websites and web apps get a handy-dandy text editor such as <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>. <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" target="_blank">PHPStorm</a> is also highly recommended if you have a .edu email address or shell out the cash. You should also sign up for Azure (3 years free with BizSpark) for some great hosting.</li>
<li>Some specific hardware, then I suggest you search online or ask someone who has experience with that hardware</li>
<li>For anything else, feel free to ask via some social media site</li>
</ul>
<p>[/su_spoiler]</p>
<p>[su_spoiler title="Learning" style="fancy"]</p>
<p>Want to learn some before the event for extra readiness or that competitive edge? Well you're in luck! Here's some awesome sites that I recommend for learning (man I wish I had these when I started).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">Dash</a> for learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create websites</li>
<li><a href="http://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> for learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and Python.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a> freeish. Pretty good. Amazing Android course by Google.</li>
<li><a href="https://redirect.viglink.com?key=9fb696e5859eb5929f21b52a20224f36&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2F" target="_blank">Udemy</a>. TONS of dirt cheap courses. I actually have used this site a lot to buy (and soon sell) courses. Use THANKYOU55 for 50% off any course!</li>
<li><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>. While it costs money, it's probably worth every penny.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lynda.com/promo/trial/Default.aspx?lpk35=7810&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship-video&amp;utm_campaign=vanity-10day&amp;utm_source=ind-wanshow-video" target="_blank">Lynda</a>. Also costs money</li>
<li><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">CodeSchool</a>. Also costs money</li>
<li>Message me on some social media site if you would like more</li>
</ul>
<p>[/su_spoiler]</p>
<p>[su_spoiler title="What will I make?" style="fancy"]</p>
<p>That's up to you! Brainstorm and think of any crazy or amazing idea you can think of. Doesn't matter how simple or complex it is.</p>
<p>Before the event starts we are going to have a pitching session where people will pitch ideas to form teams.</p>
<p><strong>TRY NOT TO WORK ALONE</strong>. Seriously, it's wayyyyy more fun when you work with a team. Teams can be a max of 4 people, I recommend having all 4. Work with people you don't know if you need to! CodeDay isn't just about learning, it's about being social. I almost always work with people I've never met before, and I leave with new friends while having a great time. If you need help finding a team after the pitching and workshops just ask me and I'll help you out.</p>

<p>If this blog post didn't answer all your questions, feel free to send me a message on <a href="http://facebook.com/Aaron7pm" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or tweet me @Aaron7pm. I'll respond quickly there</p>
<p><strong>* Disclaimer:</strong>  When I say hack, hacker, or hacking, I am using the word by its original definition which emerged from academia (MIT to be more specific). "A hacker is one who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming and circumventing limitations of programming systems and who tries to extend their capabilities. Hacking entails some form of excellence, for example exploring the limits of what is possible, thereby doing something exciting and meaningful. Activities of playful cleverness can be said to have 'hack value and are termed hacks". Yes, I took that straight from <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(programmer_subculture)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, because it's 100% right in this case (kids do not do what I just did for anything school related).</p>
